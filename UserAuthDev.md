# User Authentication Module Development Guide

## 1. Requirements Analysis
- Define authentication scope (login/logout, registration, etc.).
- Determine user data fields to store (username, email, password, etc.).

## 2. Development Environment Setup
- Install and configure Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB.
- Create a new feature branch for user authentication development.

## 3. Database Schema Design
- Design and create a user schema in MongoDB.

## 4. Backend API Development
### 4.1 Implement User Model
- Create a user model based on MongoDB schema.
### 4.2 Password Handling
- Implement password hashing (using bcrypt).
### 4.3 Registration Endpoint
- Develop API endpoint for user registration.
### 4.4 Login Endpoint
- Develop API endpoint for user login with password verification and token generation.
### 4.5 Authentication Middleware
- Create middleware to protect routes and check token validity.

## 5. Frontend Development
### 5.1 Authentication Forms
- Develop login and registration forms.
### 5.2 Integrate API Calls
- Implement backend communication for user registration and login.
### 5.3 Manage User Session
- Handle session management and token storage on client side.

## 6. Testing
### 6.1 Unit Tests
- Test individual functions (hashing, token generation).
### 6.2 Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints interaction with the database.
### 6.3 End-to-End Tests
- Simulate user interactions from registration to login.

## 7. Security Considerations
- Ensure secure password storage and data transmission.
- Implement defenses against brute force attacks and injections.

## 8. Documentation
- Document API endpoints and usage details.

## 9. Review and Deployment
- Conduct code reviews.
- Merge and deploy the feature to production.

## 10. Feedback and Iteration
- Monitor post-deployment issues.
- Collect feedback and plan future enhancements.
