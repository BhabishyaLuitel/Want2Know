# User Authentication Development Guide - Want2Know Project

## Introduction
This guide outlines the detailed steps for developing a robust user authentication system for the Want2Know project, utilizing Next.js, MongoDB, and associated technologies.

## Environment Setup
### 1. Install Required Packages
- Run `npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken next-auth mongodb` to install necessary libraries.

## Backend Development
### 2. MongoDB User Schema
- Define a `User` schema in `models/User.js` with fields like `username`, `email`, `password`.

### 3. Password Handling
- Utilize `bcryptjs` to hash and verify passwords.

### 4. API Endpoints
#### 4.1 User Registration
- Endpoint: POST `/api/auth/register`
- Function: Hash password, store user in database, handle validations.

#### 4.2 User Login
- Endpoint: POST `/api/auth/login`
- Function: Validate credentials, return JWT.

### 5. Token Management
- Use `jsonwebtoken` for creating and verifying JWTs.
- Store JWTs in HTTP-only cookies.

## Frontend Integration
### 6. Registration Form
- Implement a React form with `username`, `email`, and `password` fields.

### 7. Login Form
- Create a login form to capture user credentials.

### 8. API Communication
- Integrate registration and login forms with backend APIs using `fetch` or `axios`.

## Session Management
### 9. Configuring Next-Auth
- Set up Next-Auth for session handling with JWTs and MongoDB.

## Testing
### 10. Implementing Tests
- Conduct unit tests for utility functions.
- Perform integration testing for API endpoints.
- Optionally, use end-to-end testing tools like Cypress.

## Security Measures
### 11. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

### 12. Input Validation
- Ensure robust validation of user inputs on both client and server sides.

## Documentation and Deployment
### 13. API Documentation
- Document API usage in `README.md` or a dedicated documentation file.

### 14. Code Review and Deployment
- Review code for quality and security.
- Deploy to testing, followed by production environment.

## Continuous Monitoring
### 15. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Monitor the authentication system's performance and security.
- Be prepared to iterate based on feedback and security updates.

## Additional Resources
- UML Diagrams and architecture references can be found in the `/docs` directory.
